	<div class="about-wrapper">
		<p> Rooster is a web application allowing you and your team to schedule, plan, and discuss efficiently and easily! Whether your team is a work team for a company, or just a group of housemates who want to organize a cleaning schedule, Rooster is not picky! 
		</p>

		<b> So, how exactly does it work? </b>
		<p> One person must sign up, making them the admin of the team. The admin of the team can then add the fellow members by email. The fellow (non-admin) members have the power to post questions and answers in the Q&amp;A section and fill in their availabilities per day. The rest of their functionality is merely "reading": they can see the calendar filled with events or availabilities, and the schedules. </p>

		<p> The admin has far more "writing" functionality, having the duty to add events and create schedules, along with all the other non-admin capabilities. The events and schedules created by the admin are visible by everyone in this establishment (a.k.a. group). </p>

		<p><i> The admin holds all the power (and responsiblities), so choose your admin wisely.  
		</i></p>
