	<div class="about-wrapper">
		<p> Rooster is a web application allowing you and your team to schedule, plan, and discuss efficiently and easily! Whether your team is a work team for a company, or just a group of housemates who want to organize a cleaning schedule, Rooster is not picky! 
		</p>

		<b> So, how does it work exactly? </b>
		<p> One person must sign up, making them the admin of the team. The admin of the team can then add the fellow members by email. The fellow (non-admin) members have the power to post questions and answers in the Q&amp;A section and fill in their availabilities per day. The rest of their functionality is merely "reading": they can see the calendar filled with events or availabilities, and the schedules. </p>

		<p> The admin has far more "writing" functionality, having the duty to add events and create schedules, along with all the other non-admin capabilities. The events and schedules created by the admin are visible by everyone in this establishment (a.k.a. group). </p>

		<p> To ensure a smooth running app, there are requirements to uphold. A user must have a first and last name, and be part of an establishment. You must be logged in in order to post, comment, select availability, create events, make schedules, edit ANYTHING. Once you have created a post or selected your availability for a day, the only way to change it is by clicking on 'Edit'. You cannot input a new availability for the same day and hope this corrects the previous entry for you. </p>
		
		<p><i> The admin holds all the power (and responsiblities), so choose your admin wisely.  
		</i></p>
